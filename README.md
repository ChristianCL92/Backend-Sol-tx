## üîó Frontend Integration 
This API is designed to work with the Solana Transaction Tracker frontend application(https://github.com/ChristianCL92/Sol_tx_tracker). 
The frontend connects to this API to:

Store wallet preferences persistently
Track wallet activity over time
Synchronize user settings across sessions

## üîß Configuration
Database Connection
The application uses TypeORM with PostgreSQL. Database configuration is managed through environment variables for security and flexibility.

## CORS
CORS is enabled by default in development to allow the frontend application to connect from http://localhost:3000
